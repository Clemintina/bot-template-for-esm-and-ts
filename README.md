# bot-template-for-esm-and-ts

A basic bot template for writing discord bots in TypeScript. Although this was only tested with ``Bun`` and ``pnpm``, all other package managers should work.

Simply ``git clone https://github.com/Clemintina/bot-template-for-esm-and-ts/`` and create your bot!

If you're using Bun. Create a ``.env.development`` and ``.env.production`` file instead of ``.env``.
